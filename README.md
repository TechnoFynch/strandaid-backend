# Strandaid Backend
The project is aimed at developing a backend for the StrandAid platform. The repository contains the source code for the final version of the StrandAid API.

The StrandAid platform is a solution designed to help people in need of assistance, particularly in emergency situations and disaster struck areas. The backend of the platform is built using the Python (3.11.0) runtime environment, and it leverages the Flask framework to provide a RESTful API that can be used to interact with the platform's database, which as of now has been built by pooling the Firebase Firestore, the Microsoft Azure Blob Storage and the Cloudinary Platform.

The final-api branch of the repository contains the complete and stable version of the StrandAid backend, which has been thoroughly tested and optimized for performance. It provides endpoints for various operations such as data storage and retrieval, live streaming and object detection. The API has been designed to be flexible and scalable, making it possible to accommodate future additions and modifications.

Overall, the strandaid-backend repository is a valuable resource for developers and contributors who are interested in working on the StrandAid platform, or who want to learn more about building a backend for a platform that can make a positive impact on people's lives.
